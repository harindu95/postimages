You can use the script by running postimages.py
Eg:-
	python postimages.py india 2
The script doesn't require anything to install other than the folder contents.
The social media sites and vam.ac.uk are handled by the respective modules.

You can set api keys in keys.txt file.

Please read the notes below on each module.

Wordpress:-

As I have been unable to work with wordpress open api , I used email to post which would not for you I guess.Therefore I don't think this will be a complete implementation for your problem. If you like you can write your own wordpress module.

Example wordpress blog :- pythonscriptblog.wordpress.com
	

Instagram:-

As Instagram doesn't allow searching multiple tags or tags with geolocation , I have used google site search instead.


Pinterset:

As Pinterest doesnt seem to offer search api, I have used the web search.

Flickr:-

I have desgined to select the highest resolution image possible or the original image for a given image.
